# Dress-Recommendation
Problem Statement: Recommend the most suitable dress based on it's attributes.
1.	Data exploration: a complete review and analysis of the dataset including:
    Load and describe data elements (columns), provide descriptions & types, ranges and  values of elements as appropriate. – use pandas, numpy and any other python packages.
    Statistical assessments  including means, averages, correlations
    Missing data evaluations – use pandas, numpy and any other python packages
    Graphs and visualizations – use pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy and any other python packages, you also can use power BI desktop.
Data modelling: 
    Data transformations – includes handling missing data, categorical data management, data normalization and standardizations as needed.
    Feature selection – use pandas and sci-kit learn.
    Train, Test data splitting – use numpy, sci-kit learn.
    Managing imbalanced classes if needed.
    Predictive model building 
      Use logistic regression,decision trees, XGBoost and random forest
      Model scoring and evaluation
      Calculate results as scores, confusion matrices and ROC
      Select and recommend the best performing model
Deploying the model:
    Using flask framework arrange to turn your selected machine-learning model into an API.
    Using pickle module arrange for Serialization & Deserialization of your model.
    Build a client to test model API service. Use the test data, which was not previously used to train the module. 
    Used Jinja HTML templates with REAC and use POSTMAN Client API.
